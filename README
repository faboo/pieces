=== About ===

Pieces is a vector image editor based on a concept of scenes and characters.
Each scene consists of a background texture and a number of characters. Each
character is made up of individual shapes. There are two kinds of shapes:
polygons, and "ellipsoids" - shapes made of curves. Each shape may be given its
own texture and position in a character.

Scenes, characters, and shapes may be saved to browser local storage.

=== Running ===

To run, open Editor.html in a modern web browser.

=== Planned Features ===

* Adjusting the offset and rotation of image textures.

* Shape outline editor.

* A server backend for server-side storage and local exports.

* Better print support.
